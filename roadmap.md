# 🎵 SonicPulse: The Universal Media Hub (MC 1.21.4)

## Phase 1: Engine Foundation & Connectivity
* Integrate the SonicPulse core engine (LavaPlayer) for high-fidelity audio.
* Enable seamless web streaming: YouTube, SoundCloud, Twitch, and HTTP URLs.
* Establish universal format support: MP3, FLAC, WAV, AAC, M4A, OGG, and WebM.
* Setup automated versioning logic and local asset directory management.

## Phase 2: Immersive Audio Intelligence
* **Global Playback:** Dedicated background thread for lag-free media streaming.
* **Vanilla Mute:** Automatic silencing of default game music when SonicPulse is active.

* **Reactive Effects:** Integrate "Record Scratch" and "Tape Stop" sounds for interruptions.

## Phase 3: The SonicPulse HUD (On-Screen Overlay)
* **Media Dashboard:** A sleek, minimal on-screen box featuring:
    * Track Metadata (Title, Artist, and Source Icon).
    * Album Art & Thumbnail previews.
* **Frequency Visualizers:** Real-time animated bars/waves that bounce to the music.
* **Shared State:** Unified control between the physical Block and the Pocket player.

## Phase 4: World Interaction & Redstone Sync
* **Hardware:** Register the SonicPulse Jukebox Block and the Portable Boombox item.
* **Redstone Cymatics:** Enable the block to emit Redstone pulses synced to the beat.
* **Beat Particles:** Trigger particle pulses and "vibrating floor" logic for nearby blocks.
* **Universal Search:** A single search bar to resolve web links or local file paths.

## Phase 5: Themed Interface (The "Jazz Up" Engine)
* **Skin System:** Implement swappable UI themes (Modern, Retro, Nether-style, etc.).
* **Advanced Dashboard:** Multi-tab layout for Web, Local, and Playlists.
* **Full Deck Controls:** Integrated Seek bar, Volume slider, Shuffle, and Repeat toggles.

## Phase 6: Ambient Life & Mood Triggers
* **DJ Parrots:** Parrots dance and provide rhythmic "chirp remixes" to active tracks.
* **Art Frames:** Wall-mounted digital frames that display active track artwork.
* **Mood Triggers:** Auto-play logic based on current Biome, Time, or Game Events.

## Phase 7: Finalization & Deployment
