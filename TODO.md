# TODO: SonicPulse Development Tasks

## Phase 1: Engine Foundation & Connectivity
- ~~Integrate the SonicPulse core engine (LavaPlayer) for high-fidelity audio~~
- ~~Enable seamless web streaming: YouTube, SoundCloud, Twitch, and HTTP URLs~~

- [ ] Setup automated versioning logic and local asset directory management

## Phase 2: Immersive Audio Intelligence
- ~~Implement global playback with a dedicated background thread for lag-free media streaming~~
- ~~Add automatic silencing of default game music when SonicPulse is active~~
- [ ] Implement spatial dynamics: audio fading, occlusion (muffling through walls), and cave reverb
- [ ] Integrate reactive effects: "Record Scratch" and "Tape Stop" sounds for interruptions

## Phase 3: The SonicPulse HUD (On-Screen Overlay)
- [ ] Create a sleek, minimal on-screen media dashboard featuring track metadata, album art, and thumbnail previews

- [ ] Implement shared state for unified control between the physical block and the pocket player

## Phase 4: World Interaction & Redstone Sync

## Phase 5: Themed Interface (The "Jazz Up" Engine)
- ~~Implement a skin system for swappable UI themes (Modern, Retro, Nether-style, etc.)~~
- ~~Create an advanced dashboard with a multi-tab layout for Web, Local, and Playlists~~
- [ ] Add full deck controls: Seek bar, Volume slider, Shuffle, and Repeat toggles

## Phase 6: Ambient Life & Mood Triggers
- [ ] Add DJ Parrots that dance and provide rhythmic "chirp remixes" to active tracks
- [ ] Implement wall-mounted digital frames to display active track artwork
- [ ] Create mood triggers for auto-play logic based on current Biome, Time, or Game Events

## Phase 7: Finalization & Deployment
- [ ] Create the master Settings Menu for audio quality, theme swapping, and HUD positioning
- [ ] Configure a secure multi-archive backup system for source and build protection
